Goal:

A web-based flashcard solution could be accessible on multiple platforms and could support math and other complex equations. This would be quite beneficial to a person with a cognitive or learning disability. For example a user could create a set of flashcards of mathematic equations conveniently on their computer. The user can then access and edit the flash cards from their mobile device, eliminating the need for physical cards.
