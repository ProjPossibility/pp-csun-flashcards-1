# Document Purpose #
This is an Unofficial introduction to the Accessible Flashcards

project by team CSUN. The purpose of this document is to give a

brief introduction and overview of our project submission to

SS12. In this document you will find the description, requirements,

accomplishments, technologies used, and a high level mapping of the

source files checked into SVN. This is an attempt to help judges

understand our project and to provide a simplified overview of the

source files checked into SVN.

**This document does not contain official project documentation nor**

**future project maintainability plans. Explanation of components and**

**innovative ideas are also not explained. All of this will be covered**

**and presented at the SS12 Finals.**



# Project Description #

Flashcards are incredibly useful study aids. For persons with cognitive

and/or learning disabilities flashcards are practically a necessity.

Some digital flash card solutions exist, but are platform specific and

have limited capabilities.

A web-based flashcard solution could be

accessible on multiple platforms and could support math and other

complex equations. This would be quite beneficial to a person with a

cognitive or learning disability. For example a user could create a set

of flashcards of mathematic equations conveniently on their computer.

The user can then access and edit the flash cards from their mobile

device, eliminating the need for physical cards.

# Project Requirements #

1. Create, modify, and delete flashcards

2. Edit front and back of flashcards

3. Support standard text and math equations

4. Make as web app that is compatible with mobile devices.

5. Be accessible to assistive technology

a. Time permitting, make self-voicing (text-to-speech)

Suggested Technology

1. MathML

2. CSS
